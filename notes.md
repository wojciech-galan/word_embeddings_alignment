## Data acquisition

Initial data were obtained from CellTalkDB github: https://github.com/ZJUFanLab/CellTalkDB/tree/master/database
 on Feb 11 2023 (human_rl_pair.csv and mouse_lr_pair.csv)

Data from http://proteininformatics.org/mkumar/mipepbase/search.html (ticked every possible `Host or model` and 
`pathogen group` fields) in 9540.txt Feb 13 2023

Data from SCOP scop_fa_represeq_lib_latest.fa.txt  - Feb 13 2023

Maybe look at https://github.com/LewisLabUCSD/Ligand-Receptor-Pairs ?

Attention - it sometimes shortens aligned sequences (for example 'ACGA', 'ACGA' -> aligns only 'ACG' and 'ACG')
